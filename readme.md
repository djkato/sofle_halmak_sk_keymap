# Aurora Sofle v2 Slovak Halmak coding layout
This keymap is an original spin on the Halmak layout for the slovak layout, with programming in neovim in mind.

Keymaps in general are quite personal, so many of these key combinations might not work for you, so feel free to modify and adjust :).

# Layers:
Base layer, where the halmak experience resides:

For all symbols and nvim navigation. layer1 key+any symbols you might need, they're structured and placed in such a way that you can roll a finger to get matching pairs of symbols, like `(){}[]<>^`. Left hand has access to arrow keys and Page/home keys for quick navigation in vim layout outside `hjkl` programs.

This layer serves as the main slovak layer, where the diacritics of a letter match layer positions to the base layer. This means `a` and `ä` are under the same key with layer button. Special symbols take priority, hence `ä` is under `a`, cause `á` can be key comboed with `shift+´+a`.

This is a toggle layer for gaming, turning on a basic qwerty like layout so it's not necessary to rebind all games to special layouts. The order is tqwert, because on the sofle v2 the key layout makes the homerow different, having `w` key be in the highest point makes more sense to me than have it be slanted.

Shifts, alts, escapes, capslock and escapes usually stay static across different layers with some ergonomic alterations per layer (like added right-alt for symbol layer). 


If there's an empty key, it probably means I found nothing that would fit there yet.
